We need to implement a new “Pre-Match Scenario” section (no live/in-play). We already use API-Football v3 and we already have these on Match Detail: /fixtures, /predictions, /odds, /fixtures/lineups.

Place the new section inside the “Analiz” tab, above “Kazanma Olasılığı”, matching our DARK UI (rounded cards, soft shadows, green accent). Mobile-first, smooth subtle animations.

DATA (use existing /predictions response as primary):
- P_home, P_draw, P_away (win probabilities in %)
- P_over25 or equivalent (Over 2.5 probability). If not available, use our existing “expected total goals” value.
- P_btts_yes (BTTS yes probability, if available)
- team comparison values from /predictions: form, attack, defense, goals, h2h advantage (home vs away)

FORMULAS (implement exactly):
1) Dominance Index:
DI = (P_home - P_away) / 100   // -1..+1

2) Balance:
BAL = 1 - abs(DI)             // 0..1

3) Draw pressure:
DRW = P_draw / 100            // 0..1

4) Goals Index:
If P_over25 exists: GI = P_over25 / 100
Else: GI = clamp(expected_total_goals / 3.2, 0, 1)

5) BTTS Index:
If P_btts_yes exists: BI = P_btts_yes / 100
Else: BI = clamp(0.5*GI + 0.2*BAL, 0, 1)  // fallback

6) Strength Gap (from comparison values, each in %):
GAP_attack = (Atk_home - Atk_away)/100
GAP_def    = (Def_home - Def_away)/100
GAP_form   = (Form_home - Form_away)/100
GAP_goals  = (Goals_home - Goals_away)/100
SG = 0.35*GAP_attack + 0.25*GAP_def + 0.25*GAP_form + 0.15*GAP_goals

7) Chaos Score (0–100):
Chaos = 100 * clamp(0.45*BAL + 0.25*BI + 0.20*GI + 0.10*DRW, 0, 1)
Chaos label:
0–33 Low, 34–66 Medium, 67–100 High

SCENARIO CLASSIFICATION (pick one main scenario):
A) One-Sided Pressure:
if abs(DI) >= 0.25 AND abs(SG) >= 0.15
title: if DI>0 “Home Pressure” else “Away Pressure”

B) Tight / Low-Scoring:
if GI <= 0.45 AND DRW >= 0.30
title: “Tight Match”

C) High Goals:
if GI >= 0.62
if BI >= 0.58 => title “BTTS & Goals”
else => title “Goals Likely”

D) Balanced:
if abs(DI) < 0.15 AND BAL > 0.85
title: “Balanced Battle”

E) Upset-Prone / Chaotic:
if Chaos >= 67 AND abs(DI) < 0.22
title: “Upset-Prone”

(If multiple match, use the first matching in the order above.)

MATCH FLOW TIMELINE (3 segments: 0–30 / 30–60 / 60–90):
TEMPO = clamp(0.6*GI + 0.4*BI, 0, 1)
EARLY = clamp(0.55*abs(DI) + 0.25*abs(SG) - 0.20*DRW, 0, 1)
S0_30  = 0.45*TEMPO + 0.55*EARLY
S30_60 = 0.70*TEMPO + 0.15*EARLY + 0.15*DRW
S60_90 = 0.85*TEMPO + 0.15*(1-EARLY)

Segment label rule:
<0.40 “Controlled”
0.40–0.65 “Balanced”
>0.65 “High Tempo”

REASONS (auto-generate 2–3 bullets based on thresholds):
- If abs(DI) >= 0.25: “Win probabilities lean clearly to one side.”
- If GI >= 0.62: “Goal tendency is high.”
- If GI <= 0.45: “Low-scoring profile stands out.”
- If BI >= 0.58: “Both teams scoring is likely.”
- If Chaos >= 67: “Probabilities are close → surprise potential is high.”
Pick the top 2–3 that apply.

UI COMPONENTS (animated):
1) Scenario Card:
- Scenario title + 2–3 reasons + Chaos ring (0–100) with label

2) Match Flow Timeline:
- 3 animated segmented bars filling left-to-right on load, with labels

3) Dominance Gauge:
- Smooth animated gauge/progress showing P_home / P_draw / P_away (premium version of existing)

4) Scenario DNA Radar:
- Radar chart for home vs away using comparison values (form, attack, defense, goals, h2h). Animate drawing from 0 to final.

IMPORTANT:
- Keep it consistent with our current DARK theme and green accent.
- No betting CTA / no “guaranteed” wording.
- Must not break on iOS/mobile.
- Use existing data first (no heavy backend changes). If lineups formation exists, optionally tweak TEMPO slightly (+0.05 for 4-3-3/3-4-3, -0.08 for 5-4-1/5-3-2) and add a bullet like “Formation supports a cautious approach” if defensive.
Deliver the implementation directly in the Match Detail page.
